# Appointment System

Your project is simple. Using any stack of your choice, create a simple application as directed in class. This is a small application for an existing Caribbean business and will be delivered in class. This is a serious project and should be treated as such. Students are encouraged to build a solid and visually appealing application that can be deployed as a beta product to live servers.
